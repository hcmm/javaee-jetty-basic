# Simple maven webapp with jetty

This is a very simple webapp for Java using maven and jetty.

To run this example, open a terminal and change into the directory you cloned, and run:
```
mvn jetty:run
```

You will see some output, and when you see
```
[INFO] Started Jetty Server
```

This means you can point your browser to http://localhost:8080/swf and you should see the welcome page.
